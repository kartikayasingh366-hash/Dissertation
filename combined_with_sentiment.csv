Google_Reviews,,2025-12-06,Sandrine Cohen,UK,Global,Amazon,Individualistic,,,"Amazon has effectively established a monopoly, delivering millions of parcels every day, yet showing little regard for the customers who sustain it. The customer service is perfunctory at best; while they do respond, the agents appear trained more to frustrate than to assist. The company employs some of the poorest couriers, who frequently leave parcels unattended, and obtaining a refund in such cases becomes almost impossible. Instead of taking responsibility, Amazon diverts customers with automated emails instructing them to report the item as stolen, even when it was left in a public or communal area. 
 

 Returns are equally problematic. Items are sometimes not registered upon arrival, leading to customers being charged again for products they have already sent back. Amazon behaves this way because it knows people will continue to buy from them: it is quick and convenient, even when identical items can be found elsewhere, such as on Temu, for a fraction of the price. In many cases, Amazon charges ten times more for the same cheaply manufactured goods. 
 

 It is time for consumers to reconsider their reliance on this corporate giant, which prioritises profit over people. Despite spending £6,000 on Amazon last year and returning fewer than 7% of my purchases, I still received an email warning that my account might be closed due to ""excessive returns"".

Google_Reviews,,2025-12-05,That Guy's One of a Kind,UK,Global,Amazon,Individualistic,1,,"While my experience with Amazon has been superior to Tamu, Light in the Box and others who pedal Chinese products. I want to warn you about Amazon/vine and the DEBT being TRANSFERRED through this vine TO YOU. The Vine allows Amazon to write off products at full Retail value by giving you product ""for services"" that IRS recognizes as TAXABLE INCOME. Above and beyond the fact people are getting paid to write reviews that get rejected if they are critical or ""racist"" (""made in China"" is racism), I feel like I have been party to a money laundering scheme. I even had a former IRS agent tell me flat out, this sounds like money laundering, and YOU are party to it. You see, INSTEAD of WRITING OFF the WHOLESALE value of unsellable items (perhaps items that have been returned in unsellable condition) they pay people ""viners"" ""for services"" by giving them these products which the IRS considers as cash payment at the RETAIL VALUE of the item. Not only does this mean Amazon can now write off the full RETAIL VALUE (around twice as much) the viner has to pay Income Tax on the full retail value of the item. I wrote to Amazon several times without reply about this. I called customer support and the person had never even heard of Amazon Vine. (I tried to return defective items and the agent always says, ""Sir, I cannot give you a refund or replacement because you did not pay for this item."" I found that if I insist on returning something without replacement or refund, I was able to return items for a ZERO DOLLAR RETURN. but it did not change the amount shown on the running total listed in my account under form 1099. In other words, Amazon just got something back they paid nothing for and can once again write off for full retail value. I don't know if it is money laundering, but it is one heck of a money making scheme. Amazon has tons of stuff that doesn't sell that they have to store, move, and return to make room for more product. They have turned this wholesale loss into Retail Profits. BTW, after a review is posted, you cannot return the item because it is ""used."" It wasn't ""used"" by the person who put it back in the box improperly or without some of the parts, but after you reviewed the item, it becomes used. You cannot return it. You are stuck with it and you have to pay INCOME tax. I was told by Amazon at sign up, ""You MIGHT have to pay tax on some of these items."" I thought they meant SALES TAX or USE TAX. I did not get a paper 1099 EVER. So how would I know? They posted one in my ""account"" at Amazon.com at the end of the full year telling that I would likely have to pay around 20% (which there is no way they could possibly know what other income I might have which would greatly affect the amount of tax I owe on ALL of my income back to the first penny I earned that year). BTW, If I were to sell this stuff (as used because I had to use it to review it) I have to pay income tax on the full amount including shipping and commissions or other fees. $216k in product paid to me and reported to the IRS as ""payment for services"" which the IRS records as CASH MONEY paid as Income. As the year was coming to an end, I increased the fervor of my attempt to get information. About two weeks into this, I got a notice while I was writing reviews that said, ""We have noticed irregularities in your reviews. All of your reviews have been removed and you are no longer allowed to review items. You will no longer be able to select items. I never got an explanation of the irregularities. I would caution the general public about the reviews on Amazon. As you will find in the reviews here on Trustpilot, people get banned from writing reviews without being told why they are removed.. Even saying ""lower quality made in China product"" would get the review rejected as ""racist."" and writing a few more reviews like this will get you banned, and they do not tell you why. Even when they reject your reviews the first time they are often so vague about it you have to guess what they want removed and a lot of reviewers just remove anything negative in order to save time. To the people being solicited for the vine, I caution you. I read warnings from people going back several years and I thought I was better and smarter than they were. But when you consider that once you review the item it is considered to be ""used."" You cannot return it and you cannot sell it as new. Any warranty will be rendered null and void by transfer to another person. And when you realize you have to pay INCOME TAX (between 20 and 30 percent) at full retail value when you get paid with this item , and you pay taxes (between 20 and 30 percent) on the full price you sell it for PLUS tax on shipping and commissions and fees. All this is income to the IRS. But when you take all this into account (and there is more) when you get to the point where you pay Amazon their fees and any advertising you do, there is nothing left",,"While my experience with Amazon has been superior to Tamu, Light in the Box and others who pedal Chinese products. I want to warn you about Amazon vine and the DEBT being TRANSFERRED through this vine TO YOU. The Vine allows Amazon to write off products at full Retail value by giving you product ""for services"" that IRS recognizes as TAXABLE INCOME. Above and beyond the fact people are getting paid to write reviews that get rejected if they are critical or ""racist"" (""made in China"" is racism), I feel like I have been party to a money laundering scheme. I even had a former IRS agent tell me flat out, this sounds like money laundering, and YOU are party to it. You see, INSTEAD of WRITING OFF the WHOLESALE value of unsellable items (perhaps items that have been returned in unsellable condition) they pay people ""viners"" ""for services"" by giving them these products which the IRS considers as cash payment at the RETAIL VALUE of the item. Not only does this mean Amazon can now write off the full RETAIL VALUE (around twice as much) the viner has to pay Income Tax on the full retail value of the item. I wrote to Amazon several times without reply about this. I called customer support and the person had never even heard of Amazon Vine. (I tried to return defective items and the agent always says, ""Sir, I cannot give you a refund or replacement because you did not pay for this item."" I found that if I insist on returning something without replacement or refund, I was able to return items for a ZERO DOLLAR RETURN. but it did not change the amount shown on the running total listed in my account under form 1099. In other words, Amazon just got something back they paid nothing for and can once again write off for full retail value. I don't know if it is money laundering, but it is one heck of a money making scheme. Amazon has tons of stuff that doesn't sell that they have to store, move, and return to make room for more product. They have turned this wholesale loss into Retail Profits. BTW, after a review is posted, you cannot return the item because it is ""used."" It wasn't ""used"" by the person who put it back in the box improperly or without some of the parts, but after you reviewed the item, it becomes used. You cannot return it. You are stuck with it and you have to pay INCOME tax. I was told by Amazon at sign up, ""You MIGHT have to pay tax on some of these items."" I thought they meant SALES TAX or USE TAX. I did not get a paper 1099 EVER. So how would I know? They posted one in my ""account"" at Amazon.com at the end of the full year telling that I would likely have to pay around 20 (which there is no way they could possibly know what other income I might have which would greatly affect the amount of tax I owe on ALL of my income back to the first penny I earned that year). BTW, If I were to sell this stuff (as used because I had to use it to review it) I have to pay income tax on the full amount including shipping and commissions or other fees. 216k in product paid to me and reported to the IRS as ""payment for services"" which the IRS records as CASH MONEY paid as Income. As the year was coming to an end, I increased the fervor of my attempt to get information. About two weeks into this, I got a notice while I was writing reviews that said, ""We have noticed irregularities in your reviews. All of your reviews have been removed and you are no longer allowed to review items. You will no longer be able to select items. I never got an explanation of the irregularities. I would caution the general public about the reviews on Amazon. As you will find in the reviews here on Trustpilot, people get banned from writing reviews without being told why they are removed.. Even saying ""lower quality made in China product"" would get the review rejected as ""racist."" and writing a few more reviews like this will get you banned, and they do not tell you why. Even when they reject your reviews the first time they are often so vague about it you have to guess what they want removed and a lot of reviewers just remove anything negative in order to save time. To the people being solicited for the vine, I caution you. I read warnings from people going back several years and I thought I was better and smarter than they were.
